# Java practicum

Requirement: JDK 8

This project uses Gradle with Gradle Wrapper that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.

To run the application, open your terminal and run the command:
```sh
./gradlew run
```

To test the application, open your terminal and run the command:

```sh
./gradlew test
```

PS.: When using Windows, you may have to use gradlew.bat instead of just gradlew.
